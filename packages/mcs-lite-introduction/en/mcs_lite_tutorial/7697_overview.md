# Use the LinkIt 7697 development board
LinkIt 7697 is a development board based on MediaTek MT7697 SOC. It supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. You can use the LinkIt SDK provided by MediaTek to develop your application with compilers such as GCC, IAR embedded workbench, or KEIL uVision. Also, LinkIt 7697 supports Arduino to programming.

In the following example, we will use GCC and Arduino sketches to guide you step by step to learn how to communicate with MCS Lite on the development board.
